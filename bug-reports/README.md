# Extension.js bug reports

Likely Extension.js framework bugs surfaced by the QA testbed (`extension@3.18.4`).
Each report is self-contained: a committed, pristine repro under `repro/`, the exact
build command, full error output, and root-cause analysis. Hand the absolute path of
a report to the Extension.js maintainer/AI.

## Status , triaged & fixed (2026-06-18)

Both reports were investigated against Extension.js source. Fixes are on branch
`fix/page-script-tla-and-vendored-minjs-passthrough` (commit `767e107`) and
published as a **canary** so you can validate end-to-end:

```sh
# pin the exact canary that contains the fixes
npx -y extension@3.18.4-canary.320.767e107 build --browser chrome --silent
# …or track the channel
npx -y extension@canary build --browser chrome --silent
```

| # | Report | Verdict | What to do next |
|---|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 01 | [content-script wrapper breaks minified polyfill](01-content-script-wrapper-breaks-minified-polyfill.md) | **Repro fixture is invalid JS** (Node rejects it too) , not the genuine polyfill. Framework improved: vendored `*.min.js` now passes through untouched and the error points at the real file/line. | Replace the corrupt `scripts/browser-polyfill.min.js` with the genuine ~50KB file, then re-validate on the canary (should build clean). |
| 02 | [popup top-level await not treated as module](02-popup-top-level-await-not-treated-as-module.md) | **Confirmed framework bug , FIXED.** Page/module scripts are now built as ES modules, so top-level await parses. | Validate the repro builds on the canary (it does in our run) and keep filing in this format , it works great. |

Reproduce any report:

```sh
cp -R bug-reports/repro/<name> /tmp/<name> && cd /tmp/<name>
EXTENSION_SKIP_INSTALL=1 npx -y extension@3.18.4 build --browser chrome --silent
```

(Build in a copy , Extension.js writes `dist/` next to the sources.)

These two are the `category C` items from [`../FINDINGS.md`](../FINDINGS.md); the
other 11 failures there are sample-side issues (pre-built `dist/` references, CSS
asset resolution) rather than framework bugs.
